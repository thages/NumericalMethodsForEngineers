## Numerical Methods For Engineers

Numerical methods are techniques by which mathematical problems are formulated so that
they can be solved with arithmetic operations. Although there are many kinds of numerical
methods, they have one common characteristic: they invariably involve large numbers of
tedious arithmetic calculations. It is little wonder that with the development of fast, efficient digital computers, the role of numerical methods in engineering problem solving has
increased dramatically in recent years.

This repo contains algorithms developed in [C#] for the methods presented by the book **Numerical methods for engineers / Steven C. Chapra, Raymond P. Canale. â€” 6th ed.**. 

Some more will be added later on.
